WEBSITE HOSTING
1. Static hosting
2. Dynamic hosting
.........................
Hosting via EC2
In general when we host a website we need server. lets initialise in EC2
ec2->middleware(os)->hosting a server(eg apache server)
 
Hosting via S3
since S3 is serverless. 
when hosting, s3 will act as server and middleware.
so we can host sample website(like static website) ,actually used for testing purpose. before launching in EC2

how to host in s3:
1. create a html file
2. upload htmlfile in bucket, set it access to public.(awspage)
3. in aws s3 console. properties -> enable static website hosting (add doc name)
4. url generated
