node-cron is a popular Node.js library that allows you to schedule tasks (jobs) to run at specific intervals using a cron syntax. 
It is useful for automating repetitive tasks, like cleaning up data, sending email reports, or running background processes at defined times or intervals.
npm install node-cron
# or
yarn add node-cron

eg:
const cron = require('node-cron');

// Schedule a task to run every minute
cron.schedule('* * * * *', () => {
  console.log('Running a task every minute');
});
