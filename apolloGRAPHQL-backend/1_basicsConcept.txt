Apollo Server is not a replacement for Express; 
rather, it can work with Express or other Node.js frameworks like Koa or Hapi. 
Apollo Server is specifically designed to handle GraphQL requests, 
while Express is a general-purpose web server for handling HTTP requests (such as RESTful APIs, serving static files, etc.).

How Apollo Server and Express Work Together:
Express is a popular web framework for Node.js that you can use to build web servers and APIs. 
You typically use it for handling routes, middleware, sessions, and other general web server needs.

Apollo Server is a GraphQL-specific server that focuses on handling GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
Apollo Server can be used standalone or integrated into an Express server as middleware. 
When integrated, Express handles the routing and other HTTP-specific tasks, while Apollo Server manages the GraphQL part of the application.

Can Apollo Server Be Used Alone?
Yes, Apollo Server can also run as a standalone GraphQL server without Express. 
In this case, you donâ€™t need to integrate it with a web framework like Express, and it will only handle GraphQL requests.
