When handling payments with Razorpay, you don’t need to directly handle the customer’s card details.
Razorpay provides a secure and PCI-DSS-compliant hosted payment gateway where customers can enter their payment details. 
Here's the process of how it works:

=>Step 1: Razorpay Checkout Form
You use the Razorpay Checkout form on the frontend to securely collect payment details from the customer. Razorpay handles the entire process of collecting sensitive payment information (like card details), so you don’t have to store or manage that data, ensuring that your app remains PCI-DSS compliant.

    Here’s how the card details collection works in Razorpay Checkout:

    Generate the Order: Your backend creates a Razorpay order with the amount, currency, and receipt details, and 
    returns the order ID to the frontend.
    
    Open Razorpay Checkout: The frontend opens the Razorpay Checkout widget using the provided order_id from Razorpay. 
    
    This widget securely collects the payment information (credit card, debit card, UPI, or other methods).
    
    Payment Completion: Once the payment is completed by the customer, Razorpay sends a response back to the frontend with payment_id, order_id, and a signature, which you then send to your backend for verification.


=>Step 2: Frontend Razorpay Checkout Integration
Here’s an example of how you handle Razorpay Checkout on the frontend to collect card details:

<script src="https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js"></script>
<script>
  function openCheckout(orderId, amount) {
    var options = {
      key: "YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID", // Replace with your Razorpay key_id
      amount: amount * 100, // Amount in paise
      currency: "INR",
      order_id: orderId, // Razorpay order ID generated on the backend
      name: "Kashcool",
      description: "Course Purchase",
      image: "/your_logo.png", // Add your logo here
      handler: function (response) {
        // Razorpay sends back payment_id, order_id, and signature on successful payment
        console.log(response.razorpay_payment_id);
        console.log(response.razorpay_order_id);
        console.log(response.razorpay_signature);
        
        // Send these details to your backend to confirm and verify the payment
        confirmPayment(response.razorpay_payment_id, response.razorpay_order_id, response.razorpay_signature);
      },
      prefill: {
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "john.doe@example.com",
        contact: "+919999999999",
      },
      theme: {
        color: "#3399cc",
      },
    };

    var rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);
    rzp1.open();
  }

  function confirmPayment(paymentId, orderId, signature) {
    // Send payment details to your backend for verification and storing
    fetch('/api/confirmPayment', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ paymentId, orderId, signature })
    }).then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
          alert('Payment successful and stored!');
        } else {
          alert('Payment verification failed.');
        }
      }).catch(err => {
        console.error('Error verifying payment:', err);
      });
  }
</script>


=>Step 3: Razorpay Checkout Flow
User initiates a purchase: The user selects the course and starts the payment.
Backend creates an order: The backend generates a Razorpay order and returns the order ID.

Open Razorpay Checkout: You use the razorpay_order_id returned from your backend in the Razorpay Checkout widget, which securely collects payment details like credit/debit card, UPI, etc.

Payment Confirmation: On successful payment, Razorpay returns payment_id, order_id, and a signature to your frontend.

Verify Payment on Backend: You send these details back to your backend to verify the payment signature, ensuring the payment is valid.


=>Step 4: Backend Payment Verification
Once the payment is made, Razorpay sends the payment response to your frontend. The payment response includes:

razorpay_payment_id: Unique ID of the payment.
razorpay_order_id: The ID of the order you created earlier.
razorpay_signature: A cryptographic signature to ensure the payment is valid.
On the backend, you verify the signature to confirm that the payment was successful:

import crypto from 'crypto';

const verifyPayment = (razorpayPaymentId, razorpayOrderId, razorpaySignature, keySecret) => {
  const generatedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', keySecret)
    .update(razorpayOrderId + '|' + razorpayPaymentId)
    .digest('hex');

  return generatedSignature === razorpaySignature;
};

// Example usage
const isValid = verifyPayment(paymentId, orderId, signature, 'YOUR_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET');
if (isValid) {
  console.log('Payment verified and successful');
  // Store payment/order details in your database
} else {
  console.log('Payment verification failed');
}


=>Step 5: PCI-DSS Compliance
Since you are not handling or storing card details directly and Razorpay Checkout is used, you remain PCI-DSS compliant. Razorpay handles all the sensitive payment data securely on their servers.

In summary:

Razorpay Checkout collects card details securely.
Your frontend triggers the Razorpay Checkout and handles the post-payment success callback.
The backend verifies the payment using the payment response and stores order data.
