storage class
1. frequent access => standard storage
2. In-frequent access
 if tansition rule is enabled in storage class, then if unused data in standard storage moves to infrequent access
 cost of aws is less in infrequent access
3. Archieve(glacier) => data in compressed
4. intelligent => we can access frequently or not. (confusion state)
---------------
when data upload in default in stores under standard storage
bucket->management->lifecyclerule->create lifecycle rule
name,eli add condition if data is not used transition is made
eg if standard charge 100usd/mnth, infreq 0.05usd, archieve 0.3usd

transition is set for current obj and also non current obj(ie future)
